# SMS-SPAM-Detector
SMS spam Detector is a project made using natural language processing, machine learning and deep learning techniques. 


The aim of the project is to predict whether an SMS message is spam or not. 
The main area of the project is natural language processing based on various machine learning and deep learning techniques, which are used to model and build algorithms that will indicate the best prediction result with the highest probability.


## Main stages of the project:

    1. Data preparation
    2. Data representation
    3. Building algorithms and choosing the best one which with the highest probability will indicate whether an SMS message
       is spam or no
    4. Making prediction
    
   ### Data preparation
   
       1. data reading
       2. data preparation
       3. data description
       4. data visualisation
       5. examine and demonstrate the relationship between spam and ham messages
    
   ### Data representation
   
       1. text processing using NLP techniques
           - converting all strings to their lower case form
           - removing all punctuations from messages
           - removing stop words from messages
           - tokenization
           - count frequencies
           - steaming
           - lemmantization
           - part of speach POS
           - showing most popular words by words cloud
           
       2. Representation text with Count Vectorizer
           - n gram
           - showing k most frequent words for each message
           
       3. Tf-Idf transformation
           - used to find key words in a body of text
           - a real number is returned
           - the more frequent a word appears in a given document and the less frequent it is in other documents, i.e. the
             more specific it is to a given document
             
   ### Building algorithms
   
       I. modeling using Count Vectorizer techniques

           - SVM - Support Vector Macihne
           - Random Forest
           - K - Nearest neighbours
           - XG Boost
           
           2. choosing the best model by using Count Cectorizer
           3. prediction based on a selected model using own examples
           
       II. modeling using Tf Idf techniques
           - Logistic Regression
           - Decision Tree
           - Naive Bayes classsifier
           - SVM - Support Vector Macihne
           - Random Forest
           - K - Nearest neighbours
           - XG Boost
